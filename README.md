# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Digital-Image-Processing

# MAIN FOCUS:

Since this product can create a buisnessable environment,
We named the product as "VULTURE TECH ".

Our product is the integration of Computer Vison, ML, IoT (Automation) and Robotics.

It is a computer vision based model which will detect the disease in plant/crop by identifying the physical changes, such as: 
Changes in leaves
Changes in stem

After identifying the type of disease we have developed the smart sprayer system which will spray the exact amount of fertilizer to the affected plant/crop.
Smart spraying can be done using 3 different mediums, that are :
Cart/Tank Based
Rover Based
and Drone Based

This will really prove as a game changer for small and marginal farmers.
